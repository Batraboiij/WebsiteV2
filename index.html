                <p class="entry">9/8/22. Hurt my back playing football. Going to see a doctor tomorrow. Can't even tie my own shoes! I did an escape room with some of my friends
                    today. We didn't escape - it was really hard! I also found this really good book series called the City Spies. I am on the last book in the series
                    and I have nearly finished it. Quite sad that India didn't beat Sri Lanka. They really need to work on the fielding and bowling aspect of their game.
                    Kohli was disappointing though. He had quite a good build up but played a bad shot. End of Entry.
